# Codewars Katas with Node.js

This repository contains my solutions to various katas from Codewars, implemented using Node.js. The katas are organized into separate folders based on their difficulty level (kyu).

## Folder Structure

The repository follows the following folder structure:
````
.
├── kyu-8
│ ├── kata1.js
│ ├── kata2.js
│ └── ...
├── kyu-7
│ ├── kata1.js
│ ├── kata2.js
│ └── ...
├── kyu-6
│ ├── kata1.js
│ ├── kata2.js
│ └── ...
└── ...

```

Each `kyu-X` folder represents a different difficulty level, where `X` is the kyu level (e.g., `kyu-8` for 8th kyu). Inside each `kyu-X` folder, you will find individual files (`kata1.js`, `kata2.js`, etc.) for each kata solution.

## Usage

To run the Node.js solutions, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Navigate to the specific kata's file within the corresponding `kyu-X` folder and execute it using the `node` command. For example:

```
$ node kyu-8/kata1.js
```


Feel free to explore the repository and use the code as a reference for your own solutions. However, keep in mind that the focus of Codewars is on learning and problem-solving, so it's recommended to attempt the katas yourself before referring to the solutions.
